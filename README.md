# BrainTumorClassification
Our work here is to use image classification network architectures to classify brain MRI images. The network architectures used are DenseNet, MobileNet, Vgg, ResNet.
We compare the results with the following 2 jobs:
- Compare the accuracy results of the network architectures between the unnormalized data set and the normalized data set.
- Compare the accuracy results of the network architectures using the Adam optimization algorithm and the Adas optimization algorithm when using the normalized data set.

Dataset: We do not publish here.

Code: The network architecture implementation code sources for comparison are listed at source_code\Colab Notebooks\pytorch
